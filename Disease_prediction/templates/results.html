        <h1>Here are some tips on maintaining good heart health!</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><p>-> Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Aim for a diet rich in fiber, low in saturated fats, and free of trans fats.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Reduce your intake of salt (sodium) and added sugars to help manage blood pressure and weight.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating and maintain a healthy weight.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Incorporate physical activity into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking or cycling instead of driving, and taking breaks to stretch during long periods of sitting.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of healthy eating and regular physical activity. Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, increases the risk of heart disease.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Use resources like counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and support groups to help you quit smoking.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For adults, this means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Practice stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, and hobbies that you enjoy.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Avoid unhealthy coping mechanisms such as overeating, smoking, or drinking excessively.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Regularly check your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels. Early detection and management of conditions like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes can prevent heart disease.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Have regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your heart health and receive personalized advice.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can contribute to heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Maintain a regular sleep schedule, create a comfortable sleep environment, and avoid caffeine and heavy meals before bedtime.</p></li>
          <li><p>-> Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Proper hydration supports overall health and can help maintain blood pressure levels.</p></li>
